Subject Weekly Voice Feature Pulse – ChatGPT App Reviews
Hi Team,

Here’s the Week 2 Voice Feature Review Pulse for ChatGPT.

Top Insights:

Voice accuracy issues (accent & noise sensitivity)

Conversation tone feels robotic to some users

Strong delight among multitasking users (driving, cooking, productivity use cases)

Key Opportunity:
Voice drives strong engagement when it works well, but accuracy friction is limiting repeat usage.
Proposed Actions:

Launch Accent & Noise Optimization sprint

Add in-app voice onboarding nudges

Introduce selectable voice personalities

If executed well, we can target:
• +20% first-time voice trial rate
• +15% repeat weekly voice sessions

Voice has strong product-market fit potential — improving reliability should be our immediate focus.

Best,
Kirti
